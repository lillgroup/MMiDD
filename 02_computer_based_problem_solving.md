# Computer-Based Problem Solving
### Breaking Down Research Challenges

^ Welcome back! Today we're moving from understanding how computers work to actually solving real pharmaceutical research problems using computational thinking.

---

# What We Did Last Time

**You learned the fundamental building blocks:**
- **Variables** for storing information
- **Loops** for repeating actions
- **Conditionals** for making decisions
- **Files** for permanent storage
- **Computational thinking** - systematic problem-solving approach

^ These are the core concepts that power every computer program. Today we put them into practice.

---

# What We're Doing Today

**Your mission:**
- **Choose one** real drug development problem
- **Work in groups** to solve it together
- **Develop complete pseudocode** solution
- **Think through** all the logical steps and decisions

**Timeline:** You have about **60 minutes** to work on your chosen problem.

**Key mindset:** Do your best in the time available. This teaches you **time management** and **iterative problem-solving**. Perfect solutions aren't always necessary - focus on the best solution you can develop within the timeframe.

^ The focus today is on you doing the problem-solving work, not on me talking through slides.

# What is Pseudocode?

**Pseudocode = Plain English instructions for solving a problem**
- Detailed plan using everyday language
- Bridge between your ideas and actual programming code
- Like writing a recipe or instruction manual
- No programming syntax required

![right 40%](figures/02_python_recipe.png)

^ Think of pseudocode as writing step-by-step cooking instructions - specific enough that anyone can follow them.

---

# Why Pseudocode Matters

**Learning progression over 3 weeks:**
- **This week:** Develop pseudocode solutions 
- **Next week:** Learn Python programming syntax
- **Week after:** Translate your pseudocode into working Python code

**Benefit:** When you learn Python syntax next week, you'll already know exactly what you want to accomplish.

^ This approach makes programming much easier - you focus on logic first, syntax second.

---

# How to Write Good Pseudocode

**Key principles:**
1. **Use simple, clear language** - avoid technical jargon
2. **Be specific about steps** - don't just say "process the data"
3. **Include decision points** - IF/THEN logic for different situations
4. **Plan for problems** - what if data is missing or strange?
5. **Specify inputs and outputs** - what files do you read and create?

^ Your pseudocode should be detailed enough that someone else could implement it.

---

# Pseudocode Example

```plaintext
STEP 1: Read the data file
  Open the CSV file with compound data
  Store all the measurements in memory

STEP 2: Check data quality
  FOR each measurement:
    IF the value seems wrong (negative or too high):
      Flag it for review
      Decide whether to keep or exclude it
```

---

# Pseudocode Example

```plaintext
STEP 3: Calculate results
  FOR each compound:
    Calculate the average of good measurements
    Determine if compound is active or inactive

STEP 4: Create output
  Write results to a new CSV file
  Create a chart showing active compounds
```

^ Notice how this reads like instructions a person could follow step by step.

# Using AI Tools (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)

**Let's be realistic:** You're probably going to use AI tools regardless of what I say.

**My approach:** I **encourage** you to use them, but use them **strategically**.

**Why this makes sense:**
- You'll use AI in your professional research career
- Learning to work **with** AI tools effectively is a valuable skill
- Critical evaluation of AI output is more important than generating code from scratch

^ This is about preparing you for the real world where AI tools are part of the research toolkit.

---

# Requirements for Using AI Tools

**If you use ChatGPT, Claude, or similar:**

âœ… **Document your prompts** - What did you ask the AI?  
âœ… **Understand every line** - Can you explain each step in your own words?  
âœ… **Identify potential problems** - What could go wrong with this approach?  
âœ… **Consider alternatives** - Could you solve this differently?  
âœ… **Plan for validation** - How would you test if this logic works?

**When I visit your group, I'll ask you to explain the logic, not just show me the pseudocode.**

^ Your job is to be the critical thinker who validates and understands the AI's suggestions.

# Computational Thinking Reminder
## The Five-Step Approach

**1. Understand the Problem**
- What exactly are you trying to find out?
- What data do you have available?
- What would success look like?

**2. Break It Down (Decomposition)**  
- What smaller sub-problems can you identify?
- Which parts can be solved independently?
- What's the logical order for solving each piece?

^ Every complex problem can be broken into smaller, manageable pieces.

---

# Computational Thinking Reminder
## The Five-Step Approach

**3. Identify Patterns (Pattern Recognition)**
- Are there repeated calculations or processes?
- Which steps will need to be applied to multiple data points?

**4. Design the Solution (Algorithm Design)**
- What sequence of steps will solve each sub-problem?
- What decisions need to be made along the way?

**5. Plan the Output (Results and Visualization)**
- How will you present your findings?
- What files or reports need to be generated?

^ Use this systematic approach to tackle your chosen problem today.

âœ… **Data input:** How will you read and organize the data?  
âœ… **Quality control:** How will you identify and handle problematic data?  
âœ… **Core processing:** What are the main computational steps?  
âœ… **Decision points:** Where do you need to make choices or apply thresholds?  
âœ… **Edge cases:** What unusual situations might occur?  
âœ… **Output generation:** What results will you produce and in what format?  
âœ… **Validation:** How will you check that your solution is working correctly?

^ Use this checklist to make sure you haven't missed anything important.

# Quality Check Questions

**Test your pseudocode by asking:**
- Could another student follow your pseudocode to solve the problem?
- Are all your decision points clearly explained with reasoning?
- Have you planned for the most common edge cases and data problems?
- Is your planned output useful and clearly defined?
- Would your approach handle real experimental data reliably?

**If you answer "no" to any question, refine your pseudocode before finishing.**

^ Your pseudocode should pass these tests to be ready for implementation.
