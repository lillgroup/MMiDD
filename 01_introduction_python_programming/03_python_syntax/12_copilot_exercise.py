Drug Interaction Checker - Pseudo-code Exercise
================================================

This file contains ONLY pseudo-code comments describing a drug interaction
checker program. This is designed to demonstrate how GitHub Copilot can
generate actual Python code from well-written comments.

Instructions for students:
--------------------------
1. Read through the pseudo-code comments below
2. Use GitHub Copilot to generate the actual Python code
3. Run the program to test the drug interaction checker

Scenario:
---------
A pharmacist needs a simple system to check if two prescribed drugs have
known dangerous interactions.
"""

# Create a list of tuples containing drug pairs that have dangerous interactions
# Include at least 5 common drug interaction pairs
# Examples: ("Warfarin", "Aspirin"), ("Simvastatin", "Clarithromycin"), etc.


# Print a header for the drug interaction checker


# Ask the user to input the first drug name


# Ask the user to input the second drug name


# Convert both drug names to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison


# Check if the drug pair (in either order) exists in the dangerous interactions list
# Remember to check both (drug1, drug2) and (drug2, drug1)


# If a dangerous interaction is found, print a warning message with both drug names


# If no interaction is found, print a safety message indicating the drugs are safe to use together
